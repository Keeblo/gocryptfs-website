Other Projects
==============

There are several open-source file encryption solutions for Linux available. In contrast
to disk-encryption software that operate on whole disks (TrueCrypt, dm-crypt etc), file
encryption operates on individual files that can be backed up or synchronised easily.

This page compares:

* [gocryptfs](https://nuetzlich.net/gocryptfs/) (this project), aspiring successor of EncFS
* [EncFS](https://github.com/vgough/encfs), mature with known security issues
* [eCryptFS](http://ecryptfs.org/), integrated into the Linux kernel
* [Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/), strong cross-platform support through Java and WebDAV
* [securefs](https://github.com/netheril96/securefs), a new C++ project that implementes directories as user-space B+ trees

Notes:  
{1} Is the directory tree flattened in the encrypted storage?

Performance
-----------

All tests are run on tmpfs rule out any influence of the hard disk.
The CPU is an Intel Pentium G630 with 2 x 2.7GHz.

|                          | gocryptfs | encfs default | encfs paranoia |  ecryptfs |  cryptomator  | securefs |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ------------- | -------------- | --------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Streaming write          | 84 MiB/s  | 104 MiB/s     | 56 MiB/s       | 130 MiB/s | 55 MiB/s      | 60 MiB/s |

| ls -lR linux-3.0         | 1.9 s     | 2.8 s         | 2.8 s          | 0.5 s     | 127 s {3}     | 4.2 s    |

Notes:  
{1} All file acesses to cryptomator go through the WebDAV protocol, which is less performance-oriented than FUSE.  
However, an optimized WebDAV client may be able to significantly speed up small-file workloads.  
{2} Tested with the dave cli WebDAV client, which gave better speed than gvfs (Gnome built-in) and davfs2  
{3} Tested with gvfs in the `/run/user/.../gvfs/dav:...` mount  
{4} Known performance limitation in the go-fuse library. See [gocryptfs ticket#16](https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs/issues/16)
for progress on a fix.


Disk Space Efficiency
---------------------

(all file sizes in bytes)

|                      | gocryptfs | encfs default | encfs paranoia |  ecryptfs |      cryptomator {1}      | securefs {2} |
| -------------------- | --------- | ------------- | -------------- | --------- | ------------------------- | ------------ |
| Empty file           | 0         | 0             | 0              | 8,192     | 104 - 4,231               | 112          |
| 1 byte file          | 51        | 9             | 17             | 12,288    | 104 - 4,231               | 161          |
| 1,000,000 bytes file | 1,007,858 | 1,000,008     | 1,007,888      | 1,011,712 | 1,001,096 - 1,101,192 [1] | 1,011,872    |

Notes:  
{1} cryptomator adds a random padding which is why the resulting size is non-deterministic.  
{2} securefs stores data and crypto metadata (nonces + GHASH) in separate files. The sum of both is shown here.
