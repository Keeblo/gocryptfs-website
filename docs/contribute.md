Contributing to gocryptfs
=========================

If you want to take part in the gocryptfs projects, there are a few
ways you can contribute:

Code
----

Check out the open [feature requests](https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs/issues)
(and possibly bugs). There is still a few long-hanging fruits and
assistance is available.

There are no CLAs to sign or anything, just get going and send a pull
request. You'll probably learn more than you ever wanted to know about
low-level filesystem operations ;)

Money
-----

There are no plans to have a way of donating money to the gocryptfs
project directly.

You can however, set bounties on features you would like to see
implemented. Create a ticket on Github (or choose an existing one)
and post a bounty on [bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/)
or a similar service.

Infrastructure
--------------

gocryptfs currently does not have a mailing list. What would be needed
are hosting and, maybe more importantly, looking after and maintaining
the list. This includes answering frequent questions. A searchable
archive is needed as well.


Documentation
-------------

I try to keep the website updated as well as I can, but especially
the [Comparison](comparison) page has a lot of data that can go out of
date. If you can imagine adopting it you are very welcome. So you know
what are getting into, here is the
[source code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs-website/master/docs/comparison.md)
;)


Also, all comments on other gocryptfs documentation (like the
[man page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs/master/Documentation/MANPAGE.md)
are welcome. Pull requests that fix typos are encouraged.
